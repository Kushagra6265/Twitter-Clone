This is a front-end design replica of Twitter's homepage, built using Tailwind CSS. This project aims to replicate the layout and design of Twitter, focusing purely on the UI (User Interface) without any backend functionality. The goal is to mimic the aesthetic aspects and structure of the Twitter homepage to showcase the power of responsive design and modern CSS frameworks.
